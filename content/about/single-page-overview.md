# Single Page Overview
Despite the ABC blocks and their emphasis on simplicity, over the more than a decade online the ABCIncome.com website eventually grew to hundreds of pages of content. True, much of that content, in our no-cost "Success Resources" area, for example, was not for the purpose of explaining or describing ABCIncome. So in a way that doesn't really count towards a site being too "bulky," too verbose, too much to wade through just in order to understand what it's all about.

ABCIncome applied our proprietary expertise primarily used in the business World previously to helping people leverage similar capabilities on a personal or professional level to save money, build a home or small business, earn passive income, and achieve greater success.

The "Easy" part was that ABCIncome's system did almost all of the heavy lifting. In essence, as we liked to say, we did 98% of the work for you.

Even so, reading one's way through the material on the website to understand how the program worked still took a bit of effort.

With the introduction of the 3.0 version of our program the program can truly, finally, be explained in terms so simple that it can be condensed down to just one number (25%) and three letters, as easy as (ABC)!

Additionally, whereas previously over the years we've offered numerous programs and service levels, sometimes more than half a dozen or more at any one time, with 3.0 that too has been greatly simplified.

The 3.0 version of our program offers only two (2) classes of service:

1. Concierge Class

2. Consumer Class

And, at least for the time being, even those two choices are further simplified by the fact that currently Consumer Class is a tentative future offering, for which we are only accepting indications of interest at this time.

ABCIncome 3.0 is not accepting any new members or clients at the Consumer Class level at this time. If you are interested in Consumer Class please bookmark the site and check back, as in the near future we will be offering an email list that you can sign up for at no cost. If and only if we receive enough interest then ABCIncome will make a Consumer Class offering available.




### ABCIncome 3.0 Concierge Class Services


For discerning High-Aptitude individuals Concierge Class services are available now on a limited basis, and we are fully able to help you achieve the goals and benefits outlined on the ABCIncome website.

More details about Concierge Class will be appearing in the near future.
