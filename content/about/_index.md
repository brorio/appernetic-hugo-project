## About ABCIncome 3.0


The introduction of 3.0 represents the third and most significant and powerful (yet greatly simplified) evolution in our program, services, and offerings. At ABCIncome, now online for well over a decade, we've always believed in the KISS principle of Keeping it Super Simple. And we feel the One-Number, Three-Letter summary on the Homepage pretty much speaks for itself.




### About Phil Covington and GRPMAX, LLC


[GRPMAX, LLC](http://grpmax.com/) was founded by CEO Phil Covington in 1979 and is the parent company of ABCIncome. Along with Making the ImPossible Possible™ GRPMAX specializes in developing Uniquely Innovative Technologies and Solutions and has worked with clients ranging from small business, to government, to the Fortune 500. GRPMAX was and remains a pioneer in creating solutions that automate processes that previously required human staffing and interaction. Mr. Covington’s interest in the home business field started in the 1980s and developed out of relationships with some of the industry’s most talented and highest earning individuals, during which time he pursued the creation of the ultimate passive income solution. But _**[much more important than money](https://abcincome.com/live-better/)**_, are [the better things in life (living better)](https://abcincome.com/live-better/) that ABCIncome has also always emphasized, and 3.0 emphasizes more than ever ([it's about MUCH MORE than money](https://abcincome.com/live-better/)).
